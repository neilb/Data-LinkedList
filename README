Data::LinkedList
===========

A Perl implementation of GNU classpath LinkedList class (doubly linked list).

Functionality wise, this module is complete. However, I've neglected writing the documentation (getting around to it very soon).
Once complete, it will be uploaded to the CPAN. If you want to use this module you have to download it and execute
  perl Makefile.PL
  make test install clean all
